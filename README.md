## ECEGR 4640 01 25FQ Iot

A class project to create a Weather Station for Yes Farm operated by the Black Farmers Collective. 

Uses a Raspberry Pi, Sparkfun weather station modules, and an associated HAT.
_Note on picking a RPi: anything with a Broadcom modem or with the modern (RPi5) GPIO scheme will not work properly_
